# TryhackmeNumCheat
This script was made as a cheat, yeah you heard me right. Due to tasks on tryhackme which requires a certain length of characters as answers.

# Script Purpose
## Brief Story
  I was solving advent of cyber on tryhackme.com when at a level a brute force had to be done using the rockyou.txt file. This file contains more than 14 million words (found using 'wc -l rockyou.txt' command in Linux), and when I launched the brute force it took like forever. The informations I knew where:
 - The password must be in the rockyou.txt since it is a tryhackme challenge and they give specific tasks.
 - The exact number of characters is always given in the answer section.
 - The Linux commands I used did not give me exactly what I wanted.
 - I wanted to practice coding too :)
  
  So I started writing this script. It did not take much time but there is still room for improvement.
